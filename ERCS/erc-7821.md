## Abstract

This proposal defines a minimal batch executor interface for delegations. A delegation is a smart contract that implements logic which other smart contracts can delegate to. This allows batched executions to be prepared in a standardized way.

## Motivation

With the advent of [EIP-7702](./eip-7702), it is possible for Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) to perform atomic batched executions.

We anticipate that there will be multiple EIP-7702 delegations from multiple major vendors. To enable frontends to detect and prepare a vendor-agnostic batched transaction, we will need a standardized interface for batched executions.

In the absence of such a standard, vendors may choose to create their own proprietary implementations, causing fragmentation. Imagine visiting your favorite decentralized exchange and realizing that your EOA delegation is incompatible with their frontend. The infamous approve and swap workflow cannot be fixed just by EIP-7702 alone. 

We need a standardized batch executor interface.

Hence the utmost motivation for this proposal, which has been crafted for maximal simplicity, extensibility, performance and compatibility.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

### Overview

The minimal batch executor interface is defined as follows:

```solidity
/// @dev Interface for minimal batch executor.
interface IMinimalBatchExecutor {
    /// @dev Call struct for the `execute` function.
    struct Call {
        address target;
        uint256 value;
        bytes data;
    }

    /// @dev Executes the `calls` and returns the results.
    /// The `results` are the returned data from each call.
    /// Reverts and bubbles up error if any call fails.
    ///
    /// If `opData` is empty, the implementation SHOULD require that
    /// `msg.sender == address(this)`.
    ///
    /// If `opData` is not empty, the implementation SHOULD use the signature
    /// encoded in `opData` to determine if the caller can perform the execution.
    ///
    /// `opData` may be used to store additional data for authentication,
    /// paymaster data, gas limits, etc.
    function execute(Call[] calldata calls, bytes calldata opData)
        external
        payable
        returns (bytes[] memory results);

    /// @dev This function is provided for frontends to detect support.
    /// Currently, it returns 1.
    function minimalBatchExecutorVersion() external pure returns (uint256);
}
```

## Rationale

### New execution interface

We understand that there are already existing batch execution interfaces in the ecosystem, namely [ERC-6900](./eip-6900.md) and [ERC-7579](./eip-7579.md).

These interfaces are very flexible and powerful, but they are too overkill for our intended use case simply doing atomic batched executions.

ERC-6900 has two execution functions.

ERC-7579 requires heavy use of low-level inline-assembly to ensure safe decoding of the `executionCalldata`, aw well as proper handling of `mode`.

We believe that this proposal is so left-curved that it can be implemented and integrated by beginner developers, despite being a new interface.

Additionally, the execution functions do not share the same selectors as any functions in ERC-6900 and ERC-7579, allowing this standard to be easily added alongside ERC-6900 and ERC-7579. 

### `minimalBatchExecutorVersion` for detection

[ERC-165](./eip-165.md) is a very difficult standard to work with in due to inheritance issues (e.g. diamond inheritance).

Additionally, we opt not to make the behavior of `execute` to return a magic number for a magic input for ease of implementation.

### Only a single `execute` function

There is no need to define a variant for the single call case. 

Having only a single `execute` function greatly simplifies implementation and integration.

It also reduces bytecode size and lessens the Solidity function dispatch load.

### Use of `Call` struct instead of custom byte encoding decoding

Most layer 2s already include calldata compression and forward the calldata savings to users.

As such, we opt for simplicity to enable maximum compatibility and ease of implementation.

Using a standard struct also helps with auditability, block explorer integrations, browser wallet integrations, and [EIP-712](./eip-712) signature generations.

### Usage of a single `opData` bytes argument

The single `opData` bytes argument also provides all the flexibility that is needed.

## Backwards Compatibility

No backwards compatibility issues.

## Security Considerations

### Access controls for `execute`

Implementations should ensure that `execute` have the proper access controls.
